        Quick links to individual courses for detailed views.

    Study Hours:

        Total study hours tracked, possibly with a graphical display or progress bar.

    Target Exams:

        A list of exams the student is preparing for, with progress indicators and due dates.

Implementation Considerations:

    Responsiveness: Make sure the layout is responsive, so it works well on both mobile and desktop devices.

    Dynamic Content: Use React or Next.js (if building a React-based project) to dynamically update the student's progress, test scores, and other real-time data.

    Interactive Elements: Flashcards, progress bars, and task checkboxes should be interactive and update in real time as the student interacts with the dashboard.
